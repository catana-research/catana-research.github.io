Relational database is fixed in schema, making changes to the underlying data structure difficult,  often requiring the addition of new tables and migration of data.

### MongoDB structure

- The elemental data element in MongoDB is the _document_, BSON data structures that contain the elemental data within the database. These are analagous to rows within a table in a relational database however they do not have a fixed schema. Documents are asigned a unique id 
- Documents are themselves contained within container objects known as _collections_, which are analagous to a database table. Unlike relational database tables, collections can store document data of differing schemas.
- Documents are stored in a _database_, of which there can be multiple per MongoDB server instance.




### Inspecting your data

MongoDB comes with a GUI _MongoDB compass_ that enables you easily inspect your data and perform analysis and aggregations.
