An important aspect in the development of models is determining which model or choice of hyperparmeters performs best. This cannot be achieved however without a suitable choice of model metric that can quantify modelling performance.

The choice of metric is dependent on the task

## Classification

- Accuracy
- Precision
- F1
- ROC:
 Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve

## Regression

- RMSE - l2 norm, euclidean distance measure. Preferred error measure. Can be senstive to outliers.
- MAE - l1 norm, Manhattan distance measure. Less sensitive to outliers.
- Max error
