Jupyter notebooks are commonly used for analysis and .

## Cells
`a` - Add cell above
`d` - Add cell below
`dd` - Delete cell
`m` - Set to markdown mode.

`Ctrl+Enter` - Execute current cell.

## `??` 

- `??` document function suffix, similar to `help()` but with enhanced formatting.


### In/Out

When commands are executed, the cell inputs and outputs are stored in the dictionaries `In` and `Out`, with a key indexed by the order of execution. You can access these by calling the dictionary object with the relevent key. This can be useful if reusing a result from a cell that is computationally intensive to repeat. The exception to this however is when using `;` to suppress output, in which case the result is not persisted.

### Magic
Magic functions are inbuilt macros that can be used in Jupyter notebooks, a list of available magics can be displayed with: `%lsmagic`.

- `%run`: Run an external script.


#### Profiling
- `%timeit%`: Benchmark total execution time.
- `%prun`: Benchmark total execution time broken down by component calls.
