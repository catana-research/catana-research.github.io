The majority of time spent during code development is maintenance. Users will only use code where there are sufficient 
instructions to use features of the software. Having suitable and accessible documentation is crucial in solving these 
problems.

One solution is to produce a document that describes all the functionality and behaviour of the software. This however 
leads to several problems. Manually producing documentation is a time intensive process. Any changes to the code require 
the documentation also be updated, a time-consuming and error-prone process. Every new version of the code requires a 
new documentation set, making it incompatible with an agile development process.

Automated documenation aims to avoid these problems by having documentation that is integrated into the code and can be 
generated automatically. Autodocumentation can also be generated in a variety of formats including LaTeX and searchable 
HTML. This can also be combined with online documenation hosting sites, such as [Read the Docs](https://readthedocs.org/).
