TensorFlow is popular in the machine learning sphere for providing a powerful framework for building neural networks. TensorFlow in addition offers GPU support for calculations, greatly reducing the required training time for models. This functionality however is only supported for CUDA compatible Nvidia graphics cards, leaving AMD graphics card owners without GPU support. Fortunately AMD through their open-source [Radeon Open Compute paltforM (ROCm)](https://rocm-documentation.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) provides a custom port of TensorFlow with support for AMD GPUs.


## Installing ROCm and TensorFlow-ROCm

Follow the installation instructions for ROCm for their [documenation](https://rocm-documentation.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Installation_Guide/Installation-Guide.html). Currently only a select few Linux distributions are supported: Ubuntu, Centos and SLES. Within which only a selection of releases are supported, for example the Ubuntu LTS release 18.04.4 is recommended if you use Ubuntu. 

After installing ROCm you can install the custom TensorFlow port, [TensorFlow ROCm](https://github.com/ROCmSoftwarePlatform/tensorflow-upstream), via pip3 or conda:
```bash
# Install the ROCm dependencies:
sudo apt install rocm-libs hipcub miopen-hip

# Either use pip3 to install:
pip3 install --user tensorflow-rocm --upgrade

# Or use conda to install:
conda install -c rocm tensorflow-rocm
```
