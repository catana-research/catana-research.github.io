Pythia is a monte carlo engine for the simulation of the interactions of high energy particles. The engine is written in C++ but provides both a C++ and Python interface for the configuration of events,

## Getting started

 Download the file pythia8244.tgz to a suitable location.
Unzip and expand it with tar xvfz pythia8244.tgz.
Move to the thus created pythia8244 directory. 
Read the README file in it for installation instructions, and apply them.
(If you are not going to link any external libraries, or have any other special demands, you only need to type make.)
