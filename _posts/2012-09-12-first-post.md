# General 

This is a template built on [Chris Bobbe's](https://github.com/chrisbobbe/jekyll-theme-prologue) Jekyll conversion of the [HTML5 UP Prologue](https://html5up.net/prologue) theme. It has been modified to use GitHub Flavored Markdown (GFM) and rouge code highlighting.

# Front page

You can edit content on the frontpage by editing the files in __\_sections__. This can be either HTML or markdown.

# Code

Code is formatted with Rouge using GitHub style markdown:

```python
def main():
    pass
```
