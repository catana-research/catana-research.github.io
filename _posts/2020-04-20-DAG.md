The Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) is a powerful tool for processing large data volumes efficiently. 
The DAG can provide large increases in efficiency by removing redundant calculations and improving 
the efficiency of current task processing.

## Dask delayed

Dask delayed is a lazy DAG implementation in python. Dask provides a scheduler and dashboard that enables you to 
effectively allocate and monitor node resources. 


```python
import dask

def inc(x):
    return x + 1

def add(x, y):
    return x + y

x = dask.delayed(inc)(1)
y = dask.delayed(inc)(2)
z = dask.delayed(add)(x, y)
```
The DAG is now configured but will not execute until `compute` is called.

```python
z.compute()
```

Can visualise the DAG:
```python
>>> z.visualize()
```


```
from distributed import Client
client = Client()
```
