Structured Query Language (SQL).

Relational.

## Design patterns

Normalise as much as possible, then combine where it makes sense in terms of performance and maintenance.

Flat vs variable-value pairs




## SQLAlchemy

SQLAlchemy is Object Relational Database (ORM) that can use multiple different backends, such as SQL server and Postgres to persist data. Unlike the table structure interface of a SQL database, an ORM API inputs and outputs data in the form of objects, reducing the overhead of unpacking tabular data into an Object Oriented format. 


### Example

The SQL mapping to our Python object is defined by creating a Python object that derives from the `declarative_base` object. The member variables of this object are then mapped to columns within the specified `__tablename__`

```python
from sqlalchemy import Column, Integer, String, Float
from sqlalchemy.ext.declarative import declarative_base

Base = declarative_base()

class Room(Base):
    __tablename__ = 'room'
    
    id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True)
    
    code = Column(String(36), nullable=False)
    size = Column(Integer)
    price = Column(Integer)
    longitude = Column(Float)
    latitude = Column(Float)

```

Data can then be extracted and input by instances of this class.
